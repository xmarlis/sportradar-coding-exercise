Sports Calendar Application – Coding Exercise
Marlis Sonnlechner

INTRODUCTION & AI TOOLS USED

I integrated AI tools as collaborative assistants throughout this project to speed up implementation, explore alternative solutions, and strengthen my understanding of React testing.
My role involved designing all features, writing and refining code, testing thoroughly, and iterating until every component met professional quality standards.

AI TOOLS USED:

Claude (Anthropic) – primary assistant for brainstorming and code generation

GitHub Copilot – inline completions and refactoring suggestions

ChatGPT (OpenAI) – for occasional alternative explanations and debugging ideas

AI served as a pair programming partner, not a replacement. Every implementation decision, testing step, and design choice was directed, reviewed, and finalized by me.

MY WORKFLOW WITH AI

For each feature, I followed this iterative development cycle:

Define Requirements – write clear specifications for each component or feature

Generate Initial Code or Ideas – use AI suggestions or my own implementation as a base

Refine & Debug – review code logic, adapt to React best practices, fix edge cases

Test Thoroughly – in the browser and on mobile

Iterate Until Polished – refine UI, UX, and performance until fully functional

Example – Reset Button Iterations:

Initial implementation: large blue button

Refined to smaller size, then moved into navbar

Simplified into a ↻ icon with hover animation

Final version: minimal, responsive, and visually balanced

This process reflects how I iteratively improved both code and design quality through hands-on testing and targeted feedback.

TESTING IMPLEMENTATION

After completing the main features, I implemented a comprehensive testing suite with Claude’s help for setup and structure, while ensuring I understood and validated each test.

Testing setup: Vitest, React Testing Library, and happy-dom
I wrote and adapted tests for every major component, analyzed errors, debugged them, and re-ran until full pass coverage.

Final Test Coverage:

App Component – 2 tests

Navbar Component – 3 tests

CalendarGrid – 5 tests

AddEventPage – 8 tests

EventDetailPage – 3 tests
Total: 21 tests

Through this, I learned the fundamentals of React testing, including context providers, simulated user interactions, and debugging failed assertions.

CODE BREAKDOWN – COLLABORATION MODEL

This project followed an AI-assisted collaboration model where I handled all design, logic validation, and debugging while AI supported routine coding tasks.

My responsibilities included:
✓ Designing the overall architecture and feature set
✓ Implementing and refining React components
✓ Managing state, data flow, and persistence logic
✓ Handling styling, responsiveness, and UX polish
✓ Running and debugging all tests
✓ Writing documentation and commit messages
✓ Ensuring maintainable and readable code

AI contributed to drafting code snippets, boilerplate, and refactoring suggestions, which I reviewed, edited, and integrated manually.

TECHNICAL DECISIONS

Decisions I made:

React-based single-page architecture (assignment requirement)

Monthly calendar layout and event management features

Sport filtering system and clean indigo/pink design scheme

localStorage for data persistence

Testing scope (21 meaningful tests with full task coverage)

Decisions supported by AI tools:

Use of React Context API over Redux

date-fns for date handling

Vitest + React Testing Library for testing environment

happy-dom for lightweight DOM emulation

Collaborative refinements:

Responsive layout adjustments

Icon and button styles

Test coverage strategy and component hierarchy

WHAT I LEARNED

Technical skills gained:
✓ React state and context management
✓ Component structure and navigation (React Router)
✓ Data persistence with localStorage
✓ Responsive styling and CSS variables
✓ Testing frameworks and debugging workflows
✓ Git version control and commit conventions

Development process insights:
✓ Writing clear, testable requirements
✓ Iterating systematically toward quality
✓ Communicating and refining design ideas effectively
✓ Debugging through error analysis and user testing
✓ Evaluating and improving AI-generated code

By collaborating with AI tools:
✓ I learned professional React app architecture
✓ Observed effective testing patterns
✓ Understood tradeoffs between alternative libraries
✓ Improved my ability to read, critique, and refine complex code

ONE IMPROVEMENT IF I HAD MORE TIME

If I had more time, I would extend the application with Edit/Delete functionality and broader test coverage.

Edit & Delete Events

Add event editing and removal

Implement confirmation dialogs

Enhance EventsProvider with update/delete logic

Expanded Testing

Add integration and responsive tests

Cover smaller components (DayCell, EventBadge)

Validate complete user flows (add → view → reset)

These would complete the CRUD cycle and increase confidence in long-term maintainability.

MY DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

What I excel at:
✓ Translating ideas into structured requirements
✓ Building and refining UI/UX components
✓ Testing, debugging, and improving code quality
✓ Managing feedback loops effectively
✓ Maintaining technical clarity and documentation

Key achievements:
✓ All 5 assignment tasks completed successfully
✓ 21 tests ensuring robust coverage
✓ Professional and maintainable React codebase
✓ Clean and responsive design
✓ Persistent data storage and sport filtering features

Total development time: ~12 hours

Feature design & architecture: ~3h

Implementation, testing & refinement: ~8h

Documentation: ~1h

The process reflects a balance between human creativity, technical understanding, and effective use of AI to deliver a high-quality application efficiently.
